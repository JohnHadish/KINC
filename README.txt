RMTGeneNet
==========

This package provides two binaries. One that generates pearson correlations for
gene expression data and another that employs Random Matrix Theory (RMT) to 
determine thresholding of a gene co-expression network. A perl script can be
used to extract the gene co-expression network using the RMT threshold from
the correlation binary file.

This package was converted from Java source code to C code to improve 
performance.  The original Java code can be found here:

RMTGeneNet is offered under a GPL v2.0 license agreement.  For installation
instructions see the INSTALL.txt file.
