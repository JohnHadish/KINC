"ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"STEP 1: POPULATE LISTS\n"
"Grab sub-arrays from global super array to populate two lists of samples, making infinity on both\n"
"list values if either value from the super array is NaN.\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLE: (A increment 0, B increment 1, size 8)\n"
"global list: 1.1 1.2 NaN 1.3 1.4 1.5 NaN 1.6 1.7\n"
"aList:       1.1 Inf Inf 1.3 1.4 Inf Inf 1.6\n"
"bList:       1.2 Inf Inf 1.4 1.5 Inf Inf 1.7\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"STEP 2: PRE-RANK LISTS FOR SORTING OUT INFINITIES\n"
"Making ranking and index numbers for A and B lists that will be used to sort out all infinities to\n"
"end of list while preserving order of real values.\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLE:\n"
"aList:       1.1 Inf Inf 1.3 1.4 Inf Inf 1.6\n"
"bList:       1.2 Inf Inf 1.4 1.5 Inf Inf 1.7\n"
"aWork:       1   32  32  4   5   32  32  8\n"
"bWork:       1   32  32  4   5   32  32  8\n"
"aPoint:      1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8\n"
"bPoint:      1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"STEP 3: SORT WORK AND POINT LISTS TO TAKE OUT INFINITIES\n"
"Sort the point(index) and work(ranking) using the work values that will be used to take out all\n"
"infinities.\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLE:\n"
"aWork:       1   4   5   8   32  32  32  32\n"
"bWork:       1   4   5   8   32  32  32  32\n"
"aPoint:      1   4   5   8   2   3   6   7\n"
"bPoint:      1   4   5   8   2   3   6   7\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"STEP 4: MAKE NEW LISTS WITH INFINITY VALUES AT END\n"
"Now use point values to generate new sample lists where the infinities are sorted at the end and\n"
"order is preserved with real samples. The point value is the index to use for the new value. Also\n"
"construct two rank lists that will be used later for the spearman calculation. The rank lists\n"
"is simply the same value as the index, If the sample values are infinity\n"
"however the rank and irank values are zero.\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLE:\n"
"aList:       1.1 Inf Inf 1.3 1.4 Inf Inf 1.6\n"
"bList:       1.2 Inf Inf 1.4 1.5 Inf Inf 1.7\n"
"aPoint:      1   4   5   8   2   3   6   7\n"
"bPoint:      1   4   5   8   2   3   6   7\n"
"aTmpList:    1.1 1.3 1.4 1.6 Inf Inf Inf Inf\n"
"bTmpList:    1.2 1.4 1.5 1.7 Inf Inf Inf Inf\n"
"rank:        1   2   3   4   0   0   0   0\n"
"iRank:       1   2   3   4   0   0   0   0\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"STEP 5: FIRST BITONIC SORT\n"
"Sort both new sample lists by the values of aList.\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLE:\n"
"aTmpList:    1.1 1.3 1.4 1.6 Inf Inf Inf Inf\n"
"bTmpList:    1.2 1.4 1.5 1.7 Inf Inf Inf Inf\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"STEP 6: SECOND BITONIC SORT\n"
"Sort both the bTmpList sample list and the rank list using the values of the bTmpList.\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLE:\n"
"bTmpList:    1.2 1.4 1.5 1.7 Inf Inf Inf Inf\n"
"rank:        1   2   3   4   0   0   0   0\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"STEP 7: CALCULATE RANK DIFFERENCE\n"
"Now calculate the square of the difference between each rank and iRank value, putting the squared\n"
"difference in a new summation array. The iRank is also modified after the fact to have a value of\n"
"1 if it is not zero or else zero.\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLE:\n"
"rank:          1   2   3   4   0   0   0   0\n"
"iRank(before): 1   2   3   4   0   0   0   0\n"
"iRank(after):  1   1   1   1   0   0   0   0\n"
"sum:           0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"STEP 8: SUMMATION\n"
"Now calculate the summation of sum and iRank, making the summation of all values be the value of the\n"
"first index in teh array.\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLE:\n"
"iRank:         4   1   1   1   0   0   0   0\n"
"sum:           0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"STEP 9: SPEARMAN COEFFICIENT\n"
"Now using a single processing unit, calculate the spearman coefficient using the first index of\n"
"the summation array and the first index of iRank. The summation value is the summation of rank\n"
"differences. The first index of iRank is the total number of samples that have been correlated.\n"
