/* BASIC PLAN FOR NEW SPEARMAN KERNEL..

Prune lists... ignoring infinities
IF pruned list is big enough... (else just make result NaN)
use MERGESORT for sorting
The rest is obvious since a single processing unit will do an entire gene comparison now
(the rest is compare rank order for both lists after sorting and compute the spearman coefficient)
